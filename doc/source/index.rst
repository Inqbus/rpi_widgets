Welcome to inqbus.rpi.widgets's documentation!

Inqbus.rpi.widgets originated at the Inqbus Python-Summerschool 2020 in a small village in Bavaria (Germany).
The idea was to enable our participants on a minimal hardware environment to come up
with a capable set of widgets to control a RaspberryPi with a rotary encoder and 4x20 character display, only.

Really fast the pupils overcame us teachers in terms of functionality and presented their solution:
It was a nice and simple Framework, steadily growing for dealing exactly with the tasks we have asked for.

We teachers developed our own code in advance to guide our pupils. But our code becomes cluttered quite fastly.
Not much better than the code of our pupils.

So I decided to push the problem onto a higher level: Component Design.
The Summer-School was nearly over but I could finish it with a glimpse on component design for the pupils.
They were impressed but not convinced of this strange new design.

I do not like unfinished things so I completed the component design for the widgets.
