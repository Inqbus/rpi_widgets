Background
==========

Inqbus.rpi.widgets (IRW) originated at the Inqbus Python-Summerschool 2020 in a small village in Bavaria (Germany).
We teached the participants to use a minimal hardware environment

    RaspberryPi with a rotary encoder and 4x20 character display

and to come up with a menu and some widgets to control a device like a 3D-Printer or a green-house.

Our participants had really cool ideas and they implemented them really quickly and efficient.
But I was not satisfied with the outcome. The emerging codes are to special and not generalized.

For the sample solution design I utilized the ZCA Component architecture (:doc:`component_design`) for flexibility and modularity.

The design that envolves out of this I refined into inqbus.rpi.widgets.
