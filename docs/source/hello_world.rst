Simple Hello World
==================


Hello world code

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    from inqbus.rpi.widgets.display.curses import DisplayCurses
    from inqbus.rpi.widgets.interfaces.interfaces import IGUI
    from inqbus.rpi.widgets.text import Text
    from zope.component import getUtility

    # load the gui component
    import inqbus.rpi.widgets.gui # IMPORTANT!
    # load the base controller component
    import inqbus.rpi.widgets.base.controller # IMPORTANT!

    text = Text()
    text.content = 'Hello World'

    display = DisplayCurses()

    gui = getUtility(IGUI)

    gui.add_display(display)
    gui.set_layout(text)

    gui.init()
    gui.run()

This should produce::

    +--------------------+
    |Hello World         |
    |                    |
    |                    |
    |                    |
    +--------------------+

in your console.

.. note::

    If you are using PyCharm please check "Emulate terminal in output console" in your runtime configuration.


"Oh my god! So much boiler plate!" I hear you say.

Yes, for simply print out "hello world" this is much code.
But IRW is no display driver it is a GUI framework and any framework needs configuration.

Let's explain the code line by line to get familiar with it.

Lines 1-4 imports

    the CursesDisplay component,

    the gui Interface,

    the Text widget and

    the ZCA function getUtility.

In ZCA most of the operations with components are done using their associated interfaces - think "names".

Lines 6-9 Import the Components you like to use. IRW is extremely modular - you have to specify each component you like to use explicitly.

.. note::

    This is good python style. On the other hand it saves a lot of memory if you like to run your code on an architecture smaller than a raspberryPi.





Lines 11-12 Instantiate a Text-Widget and give it some content. IRW does not abuse the __init__ constructor.
Setting and changing properties on a widget has to be explicit, by a property call.

Line 14: Create a Curses Display instance. By default a display is 4 lines x 20 characters.

Line 16: To access the GUI component one ask the ZCA via its Interface (IGUI). This procedure
decouples the code since you no longer have to have a pointer to your top-level Object in any instance you are using.

Line 18: Add the display to the GUI

Line 19: Add the layout to the GUI

Line 21: Initialize the GUI. This initializes all the input and output devices at the hardware level.

Line 21: Run the GUI. The GUI main-loop is started which does the signal dispatching.
