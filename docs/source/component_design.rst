Component Design
================


Inqbus.rpi.widgets is based on the Zope Component Architecture (ZCA). Zope is a web application server currently used in the Plone content management system.
We have build applications on Zope/Plone for a score of years and we like this component architecture.

The ZCA is not bound with Zope or Plone. It is a self consistent set of Python modules ready to use to develop Python components.

The ZCA comes up with three main patterns ready to use:
    * adapter
    * multi adapter
    * utility
